>The source code of the game is available via a built-in source code viewer. However, it is not required to solve most of the challenges. The challenges are mostly hidden inside of the game. If something is not quite right, the user interface is acting weird, or you are always losing your fights - it is most likely a challenge! Read all the tasks carefully before exploring CursedNova, or you might miss some flags. However, you can always create a new account!
